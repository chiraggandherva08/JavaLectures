        /*  ALLOCATION OF BITS:
                in any statically typed language the variable value is first converted
                into the binary system and then the value is allocated to the particular
                position.

                ex- 8 is 1000 in binary

                    memory allocated without 8 - 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
                                                {these are the bytes having 8 bits}

                    memory allocated with 8 - 00000000 00000000 00000000 00001000
                                                {the value starts filling from the right hand side}

            HOW -VE AND +VE VALUES ARE STORED IN MEMORY:
                positive values starts from 0
                negative values starts from 1 */
